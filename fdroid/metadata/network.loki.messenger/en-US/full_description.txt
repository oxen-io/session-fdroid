Session is a new breed of encrypted private messenger, built on a unique network of user-operated servers spread all over the world. With no central servers, Session can’t leak or sell your data. You don't need a phone number or email to sign up — your Session ID can stay completely anonymous. And Session’s private routing protocols keep your messages secret and secure. No one ever knows who you’re talking to, what you’re saying, or even your IP address.

• Fully anonymous account creation, no phone number or email required

• Decentralised server network: No data breaches and no central point of failure

• No metadata logging: Session doesn't store, track, or log your messaging metadata

• IP address protection: Device IP addresses are never exposed to the person you're talking to or the servers holding your data

• Closed groups: Private, end-to-end encrypted group chats for up to 100 people

• Encrypted attachments: Share voice snippets, photos, and files with Session's security and privacy protections

• Free and fully open-source: Don’t take our word for it — check Session's code yourself

Session is free as in free speech, free as in free beer, and free of ads and trackers. Session is built and maintained by the Loki Foundation, Australia’s first privacy tech not-for-profit organisation. Take back your online privacy today — download Session.
